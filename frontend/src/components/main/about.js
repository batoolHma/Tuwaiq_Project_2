        As the Saudi Arabian Government is keen to preserve the health and
        safety of citizens and residents within its soil from the risk of the
        spread of novel coronavirus; The Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence
        Authority (SDAIA) developed Tawakkalna App in order to support
        government efforts aimed at countering Covid-19. Tawakkalna App was
        developed to facilitate the issuance of movement permits electronically
        during the curfew period for government and private sector employees, as
        well as individuals, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and all
        relevant authorities during the curfew, thus helping to reduce the
        spread of the pandemic in the Kingdom. Tawakkalna helps individuals,
        security, health and private entities, that are exempted from the
        curfew, to automatize all transactions between relevant parties in order
        to mitigate the health, economic and social impacts that may result from
        the implementation of policies taken to eliminate the spread of
        Covid-19. Now, as we cautiously return to normal life, Tawakkalna is
        helping in this phase by new services such as showing Usersâ€™ health
        condition and other services. And as a part of promoting social
        responsibility, Tawakkalna has provided many services regarding raising
        concern if there are violations, as well as providing the ability to
        notify Ministry of Health in the event of a suspected case.
